GOOD YOU WAKE-UP NOW
Great, you woke up. Well;

RANKING-TWELVE

			           SMELL(BAD)
(R1) GO BATH (NEG)WANT SMELL(BAD)
1. Take a shower, you don’t want to smell.

2. Pick out an outfit that will fit in with the latest trends and won’t make you the laughing stock of the school more than you already are.

3. Put on some makeup so you actually look pretty and you can show your face in public.

You can’t even recognize yourself, and your face tingles with an itch you can’t relieve, otherwise you will have ruined the meticulous painting you applied to your hideous face.

4. Don’t forget to style your hair in elegant curls; you can’t let the people at school see how your hair frizzes up naturally like an electrocuted monkey.

5. Shove your fat feet into your toe-pinching, blood-blistering Converse shoes, because everyone at school is wearing them and you CAN’T be the odd one out.

As you gaze into your bathroom mirror, you see a stranger, that somehow stole your reflection, and replaced it with a completely different girl.

Every part of your outfit is uncomfortable. But even though you spent hours trying to look pretty, you’ll never be as good as those other girls at school.

You are really holding back a few tears, but you feel like you are holding back a tsunami of emotions that you can’t let anyone know that you feel because they may not respect you the same way–or did they ever?

BEAUTY PAIN SAME
Beauty is pain.

(R6) BUS GET-OFF 
6. Get off the bus.

7. Find a group of people you can walk with to class, because heaven knows you can’t just walk alone.

But you don’t even like these people. They make dirty jokes and cuss a lot. They laugh and joke about you.

You know you shouldn’t hang out with them, but hey, they are popular, and you just want people to like you like they like them.

You are in the stocks, as people throw judging tomatoes and hating heads of lettuce at your insecure little head.

You cannot stand up for yourself, because you are alone, trapped, and defenseless. And you cannot stand up for yourself, because these popular kids are the royalty of the school, and what they say and do goes.

You take each comment, each judgement, each assumption, each opinion, each strange look, each remark, each criticism, each review, each report, each assessment, and with it your self-esteem plummets like a sinking ship–down, down, down, to the dark and dreary depths below.

You look at all of the other girls; your mind racing a mile a minute. I wish I had her hair. I wish I had her eyes. I wish I had her perfect teeth. I wish I was as skinny as her. I wish I had her social confidence. I wish that as many boys that like her liked me.

LIFE NOT FAIR
Well, life isn’t fair.

(R8) FINISH SCHOOL+WORK
8. Get your work done.

The only part of your life that seems to be solvable is actual school work.

You take pride in your work, because it is possibly the only thing special about you.

You do it to see the radiant smiles on your teacher’s faces as they applaud your work. Their joyful praise is the gentle rain that brings a magnificent rainbow, the sunshine that brings forth fields of sweet daisies, and one of the only things that brings you happiness.

But, it is not popular to be smart. In fact, you are seen as a nerd, too smart, human calculator, brainiac, robot, geek, computer girl, know-it-all, teacher’s pet, suck up, and any other wonderful names you can think of.

Your peers’ jealousy is the pollution that prevents a rainbow, and the bulldozer that plows through the once golden fields of daisies, the intangible object that crushes your happiness like a bug.

A’s are getting you nothing but torment.

Why am I not good enough?

Just get over it.

 

9. It’s the end of the day, get ready for bed.

10. Undress, get your pajamas on. "Wow, did I get fatter today?"

11. Undo your hairdo. "Man, my hair looks like a mop."

12. Wash off all of your makeup. "I can’t even look at myself."

This is my life everyday. I can’t help it.

I’ve been told you can’t compare apples and oranges.

I’ve been told that I am distorted.

I’ve been told that I need to be grateful for who I am.

But going through your middle school years, you are in charge of your own journey to find yourself on a small jet, and sometimes you can’t control what happens to you–the turbulence will throw you off-course.

But, popular isn’t always a good thing.

You tell yourself, "I just want people to like me; I just want to be accepted."

But skipping meals and marking up your wrist isn’t going to fix that.
